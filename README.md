# Resource DSL

A DSL for modeling the resource requirements and provisions of components
within a highly configurable system. Supports efficient exhaustive searches for
configurations that satisfy requirement-provision interfaces among components
and for the system as a whole.

This README has been broken down into several parts:

 * [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) -- Describes how to install the DSL interpreter.
 
 * [README-Phase2.md](README-Phase2.md) -- Describes the main interface to the
   DSL interpreter along with drivers and examples to support the Phase 2
   challenge problems for the Immortals project.
 
 * [README-Phase3.md](README-Phase3.md) -- Describes a more elaborate driver to
   support the Phase 3 "DAU Swap" challenge problem for the Immortals project.
